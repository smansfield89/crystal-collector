        <h1>Crystal Collector</h1>
        How you came to this place already shows you have exceptional powers... <br>
        however, we cannot be sure until you are tested, that you are a <strong>Chosen One</strong>.<br>
        Below, you will find 4 magic crystals, each holding their own unique levels of power.<br>
        Select them in winning sequence in your <strong>magic score</strong> and you will match <br>
        the <strong>magical number</strong> the Universe has asked of you. Fail, and you must leave <br>
        and never return!
